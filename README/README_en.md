# FramePack-eichi | [日本語](../README.md) | [繁體中文](README_zh.md)

FramePack-eichi is an enhanced version of lllyasviel's [lllyasviel/FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack), built upon nirvash's fork [nirvash/FramePack](https://github.com/nirvash/FramePack). Based on nirvash's pioneering improvements, it includes numerous detailed features.Additionally, since v1.9, with permission from Kohya Tech, code from [kohya-ss/FramePack-LoRAReady](https://github.com/kohya-ss/FramePack-LoRAReady) has been integrated, significantly improving LoRA functionality and stability.

## 📘 Name Origin

**Endframe Image CHain Interface (EICHI)**
- **E**ndframe: Enhancement and optimization of endframe functionality
- **I**mage: Improvement of keyframe image processing and visual feedback
- **CH**ain: Strengthening connectivity and relationships between multiple keyframes
- **I**nterface: Intuitive user experience and improved UI/UX

The name "eichi" also evokes the Japanese word "叡智" (deep wisdom, intelligence), symbolizing the philosophy of this project to combine AI technology advancement with human creativity.
In other words, it's a ~~local~~ **worldwide** modification specialized in creating videos from intelligently differentiated images. **The eichi has crossed the ocean!**

We're extremely grateful to [https://github.com/hinablue](https://github.com/hinablue) **Hina Chen** for multilingual support cooperation.

## 🌟 New Feature: F1 Model Addition (v1.9.1)

**FramePack-eichi v1.9.1** adds a new forward-generation model "FramePack-~~eichi~~ F1" alongside the traditional reverse-generation model "FramePack-eichi" (standard version).

2. **Intermediate Processing Files**: Temporary intermediate files named "{filename}_combined_interim_{number}.mp4" are generated during processing and automatically deleted upon completion
3. **Original File Preservation**: Both the original video file "{filename}.mp4" and the combined video "{filename}_combined.mp4" are saved
4. **Optimization through Chunk Processing**: Large MP4 files are processed efficiently, enabling high-quality combinations while keeping memory usage low
5. **Progress Display**: Processing progress is displayed on the UI, allowing you to check how far the process has advanced

## How to Use Tensor Data

### Tensor Data Saving Feature

1. Configure normal video generation settings (upload images, enter prompts, etc.)
2. Check the **"Save Tensor Data"** checkbox (added to the right side of the UI)
3. Click the **"Start Generation"** button to generate the video
4. Upon completion, both the video (.mp4) and tensor data (.safetensors) will be saved
5. The saved tensor data is stored in the output folder with the same filename as the original video (but with a different extension)

### Tensor Data Combination Feature

1. Upload a saved .safetensors file from the **"Tensor Data Upload"** field
2. Set up images and prompts as usual, then click the **"Start Generation"** button
3. After generating the new video, a video combining the uploaded tensor data "at the end" will be automatically generated
4. The combined video is saved as "original_filename_combined.mp4"
5. If tensor data saving is enabled, the combined tensor data will also be saved

### MP4 Combination Process Details

1. **Automatic Combination Process**: When tensor data is combined, the corresponding MP4 videos are automatically combined
2. **Intermediate Processing Files**: Temporary intermediate files named "{filename}_combined_interim_{number}.mp4" are generated during processing and automatically deleted upon completion
3. **Original File Preservation**: Both the original video file "{filename}.mp4" and the combined video "{filename}_combined.mp4" are saved
4. **Optimization through Chunk Processing**: Large MP4 files are processed efficiently, enabling high-quality combinations while keeping memory usage low
5. **Progress Display**: Processing progress is displayed on the UI, allowing you to check how far the process has advanced

### Usage Scenarios

- **Split Generation of Long Videos**: Generate videos exceeding GPU memory constraints by splitting them into multiple sessions
- **Video Continuity**: Create longer, consistent videos across multiple sessions
- **Extending Existing Videos**: Add new scenes to previously generated videos
- **Experimental Generation**: Save frames and reuse them as starting points for new generations

### Endpoint and Keyframe Image Persistence Issue (Under Investigation)

Some users have reported the following issue, which is currently under investigation:

- After canceling generation and restarting it, endpoint and keyframe images may not be used
- The problem may be resolved by deleting and re-uploading images, but it's difficult to notice until starting generation
- If you encounter this issue, please close the images and re-upload them
- In v1.5.1, we revised the code to explicitly retrieve images when the Start button is pressed

### Hunyuan LoRA Support Status

Significantly improved in v1.9:

- Introduced code from kohya-ss/FramePack-LoRAReady, improving LoRA functionality and stability
- Unified the LoRA application method for high VRAM and low VRAM modes to direct application
- Eliminated complex hook processing and commonly used the load_and_apply_lora function
- Unified to HunyuanVideo format, improving LoRA format compatibility
- Usage may be challenging even with 16GB VRAM, but disk reading before processing takes longer than the processing itself. More memory is recommended

## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (Basic functionality probably works on Linux/Mac as well)
- NVIDIA GPU (RTX 30/40 series recommended, minimum 8GB VRAM)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.6
- Python 3.10.x
- Latest NVIDIA GPU drivers

Note: Linux compatibility was enhanced in v1.2 with additional open features, but some functionality may be limited.

### Instructions

#### Installing the Official Package

First, you need to install the original FramePack.

1. Download the Windows one-click installer from the [official FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
   Click "Click Here to Download One-Click Package (CUDA 12.6 + Pytorch 2.6)".

2. Extract the downloaded package, run `update.bat`, and then start with `run.bat`.
   Running `update.bat` is important. If you don't do this, you'll be using an earlier version with potential bugs not fixed.

3. Necessary models will be automatically downloaded during the first launch (approximately 30GB).
   If you already have downloaded models, place them in the `framepack\webui\hf_download` folder.

4. At this point, it will work, but processing will be slower if acceleration libraries (Xformers, Flash Attn, Sage Attn) are not installed.
   ```
   Currently enabled native sdp backends: ['flash', 'math', 'mem_efficient', 'cudnn']
   Xformers is not installed!
   Flash Attn is not installed!
   Sage Attn is not installed!
   ```
   
   Processing time difference: (with RAM: 32GB, RTX 4060Ti (16GB))
   - Without libraries: about 4 minutes 46 seconds/25 steps
   - With libraries installed: about 3 minutes 17 seconds to 3 minutes 25 seconds/25 steps

5. To install acceleration libraries, download `package_installer.zip` from [Issue #138](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack/issues/138), extract it, and run `package_installer.bat` in the root directory (press Enter in the command prompt).

6. Start again and confirm that the libraries are installed:
   ```
   Currently enabled native sdp backends: ['flash', 'math', 'mem_efficient', 'cudnn']
   Xformers is installed!
   Flash Attn is not installed!
   Sage Attn is installed!
   ```
   When the author ran it, Flash Attn was not installed.
   Note: Even without Flash Attn installed, there is little impact on processing speed. According to test results, the speed difference with or without Flash Attn is minimal, and even with "Flash Attn is not installed!" the processing speed is about 3 minutes 17 seconds/25 steps, almost equivalent to having all installations (about 3 minutes 25 seconds/25 steps).
   Xformers likely has the biggest impact.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### About h11 Errors

When starting the tool and importing images for the first time, you may encounter numerous errors like the following:
(Errors appear in the console, and images do not display in the GUI)

**In most cases, the images are actually uploaded, but the thumbnail display fails. You can still proceed with video generation.**

![FramePack-eichi Error Screen 1](../images/framepack_eichi_error_screenshot1.png)
```
ERROR:    Exception in ASGI application
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\xxx\xxx\framepack\system\python\lib\site-packages\uvicorn\protocols\http\h11_impl.py", line 404, in run_asgi
```
This error appears when there's an issue during HTTP response processing.
As mentioned above, it frequently occurs during the initial startup phase when Gradio hasn't finished starting up.

Solutions:
1. Delete the image using the "×" button and re-upload it.
2. If the same file repeatedly fails:
   - Completely stop the Python process and restart the application
   - Restart your PC and then restart the application

If errors persist, try other image files or reduce the image size.

### Memory Shortage Errors

If "CUDA out of memory" or "RuntimeError: CUDA error" appears:

1. Increase the `gpu_memory_preservation` value (e.g., 12-16GB)
2. Close other applications using the GPU
3. Restart and try again
4. Reduce image resolution (around 640x640 recommended)

### Detailed Memory Consumption Analysis

Based on detailed analysis of the entire source code, actual memory consumption is as follows:

#### Basic Model Configuration and Load-Time Memory Consumption

- **transformer** (FramePackI2V_HY): Approximately 25-30GB (when state dictionary is fully expanded)
- **text_encoder**, **text_encoder_2**, **vae** total: Approximately 8-10GB
  v1.9.1 adds unload processing to reduce RAM usage
- **Other auxiliary models** (image_encoder, etc.): About 3-5GB
- **Total baseline RAM consumption**: About 36-45GB

#### Memory Consumption Pattern During LoRA Application

LoRA application processing flow:
1. **Original state dictionary**: About 25-30GB (transformer size)
2. **LoRA file loading**: 50MB to 500MB
3. **During merge processing**: Temporarily requires an additional 25-30GB as it duplicates the original state dictionary while merging with LoRA
   Note: v1.9.1 revises this process, significantly reducing RAM consumption
4. **Peak during application process**: Basic consumption + state dictionary duplication ≈ about 70-90GB

**Important**: This significant memory consumption increase occurs only during the initial LoRA loading. When loading a different LoRA file or changing LoRA application strength or FP8 settings, such large memory peaks do not occur. For normal video generation operations after the initial load, memory usage remains at the basic consumption level (around 36-45GB).

#### Recommended System Requirements

- **Standard execution RAM requirement**: 36-45GB
- **Temporary peak during LoRA application**: 70-90GB
- **Recommended total memory**: Combined RAM + pagefile should be at least 40GB
  
For example:
- 32GB RAM system → Set pagefile to approximately 40GB
- 64GB RAM system → Set pagefile to approximately 20GB

#### Additional Memory Requirements When Using the F1 Model

When using the F1 model, the following additional memory is required on top of the standard model:
- **F1 model initial download**: About 24GB
- **Storage capacity when both models coexist**: About 54GB

#### Note for No-Swap Environments like Google Colab

Running in environments without swap memory has very strict limitations:
- RAM limits (13-15GB) make it difficult to load even the basic model
- Cannot handle the temporary memory peak of 70-90GB required during LoRA application
- Without swap, the system crashes immediately with OOM errors when memory is insufficient

### Video Display Issues

There are issues with videos not displaying in some browsers (especially Firefox) and macOS:

- Symptoms: Video doesn't display in Gradio UI, thumbnails don't display in Windows, can't play in some players
- Cause: Video codec setting issue in `\framepack\webui\diffusers_helper\utils.py`

**This issue has been resolved by merging the MP4 Compression feature from the original project**

### Docker-Specific Troubleshooting

When using the Docker container:

1. **GPU Not Detected**: 
   - Ensure NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed
   - Verify your GPU is compatible (minimum 8GB VRAM)
   - Check that the driver in your docker-compose.yml matches your installed NVIDIA driver

2. **Container Crashes on Start**:
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
   - Ensure your system has enough disk space for the models (~30GB)
   - Verify host system has sufficient RAM (minimum 16GB recommended)

3. **Access Issues**:
   - Make sure port 7861 is not being used by another application
   - Try accessing with http://localhost:7861 (not https)
   - If using a remote system, ensure the firewall allows access to port 7861
